Practice: Make your own calculator Interface ...with implementation

• Each arithmetic operation should be defined in abstract methods. 
• Define a Scanner in the interface.
• Make static helper methods that take input from the user.
• Make a default method called calculate.
• Implement your interface. 
• NO STUB METHODS!
